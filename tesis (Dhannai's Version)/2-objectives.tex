\section{Objectives}

\subsection{General objective}

The mean goal of the present work is to study velocity and density variability in the water column of a small and highly stratified estuary during its closed state and relate them to wind stress, to use the collected information to delve into the study of water bodies of this type. In addition, this research seeks to gain a better understanding of the relationship between wind stress and the behavior of layers of different densities within the closed state estuary.  Our case study is the Pescadero Estuary, a bar-built estuary in California that represents many other small inlet systems elsewhere in the world. Data sets of wind and pressure at this site containing several mouth openings and closures are going to be used.\\

\subsection{Specific objectives}

The specific objectives of this study are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [(1)] To make a time-series analysis of data collected from the Pescadero estuary using depth, temperature, salinity, and velocities collected from the estuary and the wind velocities obtained at 3 meters height.
    \item [(2)] To determine the effect of wind stress on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the estuary while the inlet is closed focusing on stratification.
    \item [(3)] To study the wind-estuary interaction and the effects of other external factors such as water inflow and wave overtopping in this interaction.
\end{enumerate}
