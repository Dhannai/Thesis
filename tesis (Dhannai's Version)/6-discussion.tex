Why during wave overtopping the bottom of NM increase and then go to normal
explain the  continuous increase in DC at the bottom

Near the mouth the upper layer is thinner probably because the salinity is higher due to the waves that are overtopping the sandbar.

Hablar sobre como detecta el wavelet las olas (poner imagen de art congreso)

Pescadero funciona como tal y tales cuerpos de agua (buscar) (discusion de kelly 2017 buena)
payandeh tiene algunos pára comparar con enfoqye de viento
wind: orientation of the bay, shallowness

colocar problemas de los métodos de analisis
wedberner number is too aproximasted
frequency analysis doesnt show an specific time, shows all the dataset

acording to Paugam 2021 the drag coefficient Cd can be difficult to estimate in shallow water %discusion?

We can notice a wind event in the offshore direction just before there is an increase in the Pescadero creek discharge, and we can observe this situation before other increases in flow, meaning the change of direction of the wind could happen during a storm.
The wavelet analysis shows high-frequency waves when that occurs (Figure 3-D and 3-H), but it could be hiding some insignificant wave overshoot events.
