The importance of the Richardson number is explained. Interfacial stability is examined, and the onset of Rayleigh-Taylor instability is analyzed. Continuously stratified flow is analyzed and expressed in terms of the stratification frequency. Internal waves and seiches are introduced, and the corresponding propagation properties are studied. Density currents are described, and their propagation under stratified flow conditions is quantified. The interplay between stratification and turbulence is discussed, and the importance of the collapse of turbulence in stratified flow in lakes, estuaries and the atmospheric boundary layer is explained. The Reynolds-averaged Boussinesq equations are derived, and various approximations are presented.}
